        <p class="strain-description">Death Star is the potent cross of Sensi Star and Sour Diesel and has the
            shared sativa and indica effects
            of its
            parents. It has a mixed taste that combines sweet, skunk, and fuel aromas into a very potent fragrance
            that isnâ€™t easy
            to hide. This strain may not have the ability to destroy planets, but it does have quite the powerful
            buzz. Effects can
            be slow to onset, but once they do, Death Star takes away all cares and replaces them with a state of
            relaxed euphoria.
            Great for daytime or nighttime use, this Ohio native now has fans throughout the galaxy.
